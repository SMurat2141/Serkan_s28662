1. Original Situation
We started with a LegacyApp project that had a UserService class containing all logic for:

Validating user data (name, email, age).

Determining a user’s credit limit (via a remote service).

Storing the user (via legacy UserDataAccess).

This single class handled multiple responsibilities and had strong coupling to other parts of the application (making it hard to test, maintain, or extend).

We needed to refactor it without altering the existing behavior (no changes to the final functionality).

2. Key Refactoring Goals
Improve Separation of Concerns (SoC) and Adherence to SOLID

Single Responsibility Principle: Each class or method should do one thing well.

Open/Closed Principle: We can add new functionality without heavily modifying existing code.

Dependency Inversion Principle: Depending on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete classes, making the code more testable and flexible.

Preserve Existing Behavior

The UserDataAccess class and how other applications call UserService must remain unchanged.

The Program.cs in LegacyAppConsumer calls new UserService() without parameters, so we needed to keep a parameterless constructor in UserService.

Improve Testability

By introducing interfaces and dependency injection, we can swap out real implementations with test stubs or mocks in unit tests.

3. Main Changes and Introduced Components
Interfaces

IUserService: Defines how the user service is consumed (e.g., AddUser(...)).

IUserValidator: Encapsulates validation (names, email, age checks).

IClientRepository: Provides an abstraction for fetching Client data (previously done via ClientRepository).

IUserCreditProcessor: Centralizes logic for determining and updating a user’s credit limit.

IUserCreditService + IUserCreditServiceFactory: Abstract and factory for calling the credit limit service.

Having these interfaces means we can inject or mock each part as needed for testing or extensions.

Refactored UserService

Now focuses on coordinating the process:

Validation (delegated to IUserValidator).

Fetching the client (via IClientRepository).

Processing credit (via IUserCreditProcessor).

Saving the user (via the unchanged UserDataAccess).

Provides two constructors:

A parameterless constructor that internally creates default implementations (for backward compatibility).

A DI-friendly constructor that takes dependencies as parameters (for unit testing or custom usage).

Extracted UserValidator

Implements IUserValidator.

Checks for non-empty names, valid email format, and a minimum age of 21.

Simplifies UserService by removing validation logic from it.

Extracted UserCreditProcessor

Implements IUserCreditProcessor.

Uses IUserCreditServiceFactory (which in turn creates UserCreditService) to retrieve credit limits.

Handles logic of doubling credit limits for "ImportantClient" and skipping credit checks for "VeryImportantClient".

Allows UserService to remain focused on business flow, not credit logic details.

Kept UserDataAccess, Client, User, etc., the Same

We did not modify UserDataAccess (it is legacy and untouchable).

Client and User remain in the LegacyApp namespace (or a separate namespace if desired, but we made sure the references match).

Namespace and Using Directives

We made sure each interface or class file had the correct using statements (like using System; to fix the DateTime resolution errors).

For Client, we confirm it’s in the LegacyApp namespace and used that in the files that refer to it.

4. Overall Effect of the Refactoring
Same External Behavior:
The flow of AddUser and final outcome (i.e., whether a user is added successfully or not) is unchanged. The program still prints the same success message.

Cleaner Code & Better Structure:
We split out responsibilities into separate classes and interfaces. This reduces complexity in each class.

Testability:
We can now create unit tests that mock IClientRepository (so we don’t do actual remote calls) and mock IUserCreditService or IUserCreditProcessor (so we don’t need to wait for random sleeps). We can independently test UserValidator’s logic in isolation.

Backward Compatibility:
The Program.cs file in LegacyAppConsumer still compiles and runs with var userService = new UserService(); because UserService has a parameterless constructor.
